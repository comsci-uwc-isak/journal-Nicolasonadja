Day 4
As I was expecting today was great. I do not really know what is happenening but the time just go by in the class. I am really into the way Mr Rubben is teaching.
I was engagde with class event if I did not participate that much. 
I think that I am maybe the that is not fully comprehending computer science at this time because most of them star before me as, I change class at the middle of the semester without having any
prior knowlegde like carlos. But this I ereally feel myseft insides the class. It is going me the motivation to continu. 
We start to work on OSI and how every thing is connected. and that nothing will be possible without the physical part. We learn the different layer form the physical to the most abstract. 
The next part was the best we create a code in PUG that we translate into HTML for us to be able to use it in the terminal.
