Today class was really impressive. I actually learm a lot at the beginning I was really confuse by the teacher style, but as soon as he star explaining and giving the cource I knew that he know what his taking about.
I remenber getting into the terminal of computer something I did not know about and playing around with the concept and key was really helpfull. AS now I can manage to  navigate throught the the terminal and even try to writte script in bast.
