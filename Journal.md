Today class was really impressive. I actually learm a lot at the beginning I was really confuse by the teacher style,
but as soon as he star explaining and giving the cource I knew that he know what his taking about.


Day 2
I remenber getting into the terminal of computer something I did not know about and playing around with the concept and key was really helpfull. 
AS now I can manage to  navigate throught the the terminal and even try to writte script in bast.

Day 4
As I was expecting today was great. I do not really know what is happenening but the time just go by in the class. I am really into the way Mr Rubben is teaching.
I was engagde with class event if I did not participate that much. 
I think that I am maybe the that is not fully comprehending computer science at this time because most of them star before me as, I change class at the middle of the semester without having any
prior knowlegde like carlos. But this I ereally feel myseft insides the class. It is going me the motivation to continu. 
We start to work on OSI and how every thing is connected. and that nothing will be possible without the physical part. We learn the different layer form the physical to the most abstract. 
The next part was the best we create a code in PUG that we translate into HTML for us to be able to use it in the terminal.

Day 5 
Today was really nice, we work one  donwloading and setting up WebStrom  and intergrate Ctylus, Coffeescript and Pug via out terminal.
In order to create a Webpage with the attribute we wanted, we  had to configurate the WebStrom prefferences to had all the features dwonload throuht the terminal.
Next we played with the code that was already constract for us by the teacher.

This is an example of the html code that I change in order to add a pisture:
doctype html
head
    title My first styled page
    link(rel='stylesheet' href='mystyle.css')
    script(type='text/javascript' src='interactive.js')
    link(rel='stylesheet' href='mystyle.css')
    title My first styled page
ul.navbar
    li
        a(href='index.html') Home page
    li
        a(href='town.html') My town
    li
        a(href='links.html') Links
h1 My first styled page
p
    | Welcome to my styled page!
    section
        nav
            ul
                li.title Study Earth
                li.robot
                    img(src='Earth.jpg' alt='Earth' width='10px')
                    article

DAY 6 (Sept 12)
Today class was relaxing, i am not saying it was too easy but i will say intertaining, we work on creating a logging page by using pug syntax that is convert into HTML. It was facination because as we were going toward the page started to look like a actual logging page. I did not expect that, because i thought it will be harder even if we haven actually work on the back end, I was really happy of the work I have done.
